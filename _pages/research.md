## Ants
Acacia-ants in the genus *Pseudomyrmex* are iconic examples of plant-ant mutualism. These ants obligately nest in the hollow thorns grown by acacias and feed exclusively on the extra-floral nectar and Beltian food bodies produced by their plants. In exchange for this nesting space and food, the ants aggressively protect their hosts against herbivores, pathogenic fungi, and encroaching plants. The ants are incredibly effective and plants without resident ants are quickly overrun by herbivory and disease.

Plant-ant mutualism has evolved at least three times within *Pseudomyrmex*, making this an ideal group in which to study the evolution of this behavior. During my PhD, we compared the genomes of eight species within this genus, including three mutualistic species. Remarkably, these data show that mutualists all have higher rates of molecular evolution genome-wide. These results are now published [here](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12679).

Although we were unable to clearly identify the mechanism underlying these differences in evolutionary rates, this finding piqued my interest in the connections between life history evolution and genome evolution. Questions on this topic form the basis of much of my research program.
